   set/changed only in the system registry.

0. Key "/u <username>"
   The data from [HKCU\Software\Far] is copied into [HKCU\Software\Far\Users]
   only if the following registry branch doesn't exist:
   [HKCU\Software\Far\Users\<username>].
   That means that changing  parameters  described  below  will  not  affect
   existing user  profiles.  Setting  for  "<username>"  should  be  changed
   relative to the branch [HKCU\Software\Far\Users\<username>].

1. [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Far\Editor]
   "WordDiv":REG_SZ
   Words delimiters. Used by the internal  editor  for  the  Ctrl-Left  and

   The key "System/ConsoleDetachKey" of REG_SZ type allows to  specify  the
   key combination that can be used to detach the FAR Manager console  from
   a non-interactive process running in it.
   If a long-running process (for example, archiving)  was  run  in  a  FAR
   console, and for some reasons this very instance of FAR  is  needed  (an
   editor in the background) or it is undesirable to run a new instance  of
   FAR, pressing this key combination will create a  new  console  for  FAR
   where it will continue running as if the process has already ended,  and
   the process will continue working in the old console.
   For example, the value of "ConsoleDetachKey" equal to "CtrlAltX" assigns
   the shortcut Ctrl-Alt-X to the detach function.
   The default value is "CtrlAltTab".

28.[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Far\Colors]

40.User menu caption
   If  you  think  that  a  user  menu  caption  looking  like  "Main  menu
   (Registry)" is a poor design choice, you can make a small correction  in
   the LNG files:
     change the line after the label "// <...menu (Registry)>" to an
     empty string and restart the FAR Manager. After that, the user
     menu caption will look like "Main menu".

41.[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Far\Dialog]

   If the value is equal to 1, FAR will automatically  prepend  the  plugin
   prefix to the path (except for plugins that point to  real  files,  like
   the Temporary panel).
   If the value is equal to 0, FAR does not prepend prefixes.
   The default value is 0.

43.[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Far\Panel\Layout]
   "ScrollbarMenu":REG_DWORD
   The key "Panel/Layout/ScrollbarMenu" of DWORD type  enables  showing  of
   the scrollbar in menus if the number of items exceeds the menu height.

   The rule does not work under Windows 9x.
   Known problems:
      If the close button is clicked when there is an unsaved file in
      the editor, FAR shows the save prompt, but the system still
      terminates the process without waiting for the user's response.
   Can have one of the following values:
     0 - do not save the settings
