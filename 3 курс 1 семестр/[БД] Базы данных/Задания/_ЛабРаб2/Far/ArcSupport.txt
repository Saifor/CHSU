1. Introduction
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

   Archiver support in FAR means that  you  can  create,  view  and  modify
archives of different types. The most popular archive types are  RAR,  ZIP,
ARJ,  HA  and  CAB.  A  comprehensive  description  of  various  archivers,
comparison tests and links to Web sites of companies that produce  archives
can be found at the following Web site (Russian): http://arctest.narod.ru

   If all the capabilities described above work fine on your  computer, you
can read no further.

   Just like many other features of FAR, archiver  support  is  implemented
with plugins. The  most  popular  plugins  providing  archive  support  are
MultiArc and 7-zip.

2. MultiArc.
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

   This is a standard plugin supplied  with  FAR.  It  implements  archiver
support in the following way:

   - Viewing archive contents is done by the  plugin  itself,  through  the
respective  plugin  extension  module  (<ArchiveType>.fmt)  or  by  calling
(automatically and invisibly for the user) external utility programs.

   - To create or modify archives, external archiver programs are used.  In
order to make it possible to use those programs, MultiArc must be  able  to
locate them. This usually means that all archivers are stored in  a  single
directory that is listed in the environment variable %PATH% (if you do  not
understand this, consult your  system  administrator  or  another  computer
specialist).

The most commonly used archivers are:

  - RAR. The file rar.exe from the WinRAR distribution is used
    (http://rarsoft.com/). It is recommended to import  into  the  registry
    the file Far\Addons\Archivers\Rar25.reg.

  - ARJ. The file arj32.exe from the archive distribution is used
    (http://www.arjsoft.com/). It is necessary to import into the  registry
    the file Far\Addons\Archivers\Arj32.reg.

  - ZIP. Many ZIP archivers exist, but it is recommended to use the  32-bit
    console PKZip archiver. It can be obtained from the site
    http://pkware.com/ by downloading the distribution "PKZip Command Line"
    of the latest available version. After installing  it,  you  will  need
    only the file pkzipc.exe. It is necessary to import into  the  registry
    the file Far\Addons\Archivers\PkZip4.reg.

  - HA. It is recommended to use a 32-bit Windows version of this archiver,
    that can be downloaded, for example, from this site:
    http://www.moris.ru/~spinoza/download/ha_nt.zip.

  - CAB. It is recommended to use the MsCab archiver (it can be downloaded
    from http://mateuszb.republika.pl/). The default options  of  Cab.fmt
    are configured to use this archiver.

  - GZIP. You should download a Windows 9x/NT binary from the official site
    of the program - http://www.gzip.org/. Out of the entire distribution,
    only the file gzip.exe is needed.
    http://plugring.farmanager.com/downld/files/arc/utils/gzip32.zip

  - TAR. The Win32 port of GNU TAR 1.12 should be used.
    http://plugring.farmanager.com/downld/files/arc/utils/tar32.rar

  - BZIP2. Version 1.0 or later should be used. It can be downloaded from
    the official homepage of the program.
    http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/

  - ACE. You should download the distribution from  http://winace.com.  The
    file ace32.exe is used.

  - JAR (.J). Version 1.02 (32 bit) or later should be used. It can be
    downloaded from the official homepage: http://www.arjsoft.com

  - many other archivers can be downloaded from the following Web site:
    http://ftp.elf.stuba.sk/packages/pub/pc/pack/

   Advantages: the MultiArc plugin supports dozens  of  archive  types  and
other files with a structure defined by some rules. It is also  extensible,
meaning that support for almost any archiver can be added if necessary.

   Disadvantages: the archivers supporting all archive types that  you  use
must be installed on your comuter.

3. 7-zip
컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴컴

   This plugin (it can be downloaded from http://7-zip.com/) supports  only
the following archive types: RAR, CAB, ZIP, GZip,  TAR  and  BZip2.  Unlike
MultiArc, 7-zip contains  all  the  necessary  code  for  supporting  these
archive types and does not require any additional archivers.

   Advantages: it is not required to install the archivers separately,  and
consequently, the plugin can be used for creating and  modifying  archivers
almost immediately after  the  installation.  Can  be  used  together  with
MultiArc.

   Disadvantages: few supported archive types.
