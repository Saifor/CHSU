                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                    How to install/uninstall plugins
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


INSTALL A PLUGIN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Read the plugin documentation to find the installation instructions,
   the minimum version of FAR required for correct plugin operation and
   so on.

   Install the plugin as described there.

2. If there are no installation instructions in the documentation, or
   if it was impossible to install the plugin according to the
   instructions given in the documentation, install the plugin
   the following way:

   a) create a subdirectory with an arbitrary name in the Plugins
      subdirectory of the directory where FAR is installed.

   b) copy the contents of the plugin distribution archive to that
      directory (usually it is enough to copy only *.dll, *.hlf, *.lng)

   c) restart FAR manager.

   If successful, the plugin will add a menu item to the plugins menu or
   will perform the necessary functions as described in its documentation.


REMOVE A PLUGIN
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Read the plugin documentation to find the uninstallation instructions.
   Remove the plugin as described there.

2. If there are no uninstallation instructions in the documentation, or it
   was impossible to remove the plugin according to the instructions given
   in the documentation, remove the plugin the following way:

   a) Start a new instance of FAR manager with "/p" command line switch
      (FAR will start without plugins).

   b) Quit all other FAR manager instances.

   c) Delete the directory containing the plugin to be removed.

   d) Clear plugins cache. Use the file ClearPluginsCache.bat to complete
      this operation.

   e) You can try to find and delete all registry entries belonging
      to that plugin. If you do not know how to do it, ask your system
      administrator. However, this step is completely optional: there is
      no harm in not deleting these registry entries.
